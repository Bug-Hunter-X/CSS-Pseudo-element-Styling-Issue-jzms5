The solution involves addressing the potential issues that might prevent the pseudo-element from being rendered.  Here's a corrected version:

```css
.container {
  position: relative; /* Ensure positioning context if needed */
}

.container::before {
  content: "This text will appear!";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  display: block;
  /* Add other styles as needed */
}
```

Key improvements:

1. **`position: relative;` (on .container):**  This ensures that the container has a positioning context, which is sometimes required for absolute positioning of pseudo-elements. 
2. **Valid `content`:**  A non-empty string is used for the content property ensuring the pseudo-element has something to render.
3. **Specificity:** It's important to confirm the specificity of this CSS rule to ensure that it overrides any other rules.   You might need to use more specific selectors or the `!important` flag if other styles are interfering (though this should be used cautiously).
4. **Debugging:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element and examine its computed styles to determine why the pseudo-element might not be displayed.  Check for display issues, specificity conflicts and other potential problems.
