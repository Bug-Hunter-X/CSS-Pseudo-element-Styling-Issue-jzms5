The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error: applying a style to a pseudo-element that doesn't exist or isn't properly targeted.

```css
.container::before {
  content: "This text should appear!";
  display: block;
}
```

The problem lies in the context where this code is used. If the `.container` element lacks the necessary conditions for the `::before` pseudo-element to be rendered, it will simply be ignored. This could be due to several factors: 

* **Missing content:**  The `content` property is essential for pseudo-elements. Omitting it or using an invalid value like an empty string (`content: '';`) might lead to the style not being applied.
* **Incorrect selector:** The selector `.container` might not be selecting the intended element, or if the code is improperly scoped and the selector cannot find an appropriate element.
* **Display issues:** If the `.container` or its parent elements have `display: none` or other properties that hide the container, the pseudo-element is also hidden. 
* **Specificity problems:** Other CSS rules with higher specificity might override the styles applied to the pseudo-element.
