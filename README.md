# CSS Pseudo-element Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in CSS: applying styles to a pseudo-element (`:before` or `:after`) that doesn't render due to various reasons. The problem is illustrated in `bug.css` and a solution is provided in `bugSolution.css`.

## Problem
The `bug.css` file contains CSS that attempts to style a `::before` pseudo-element of an element with the class `container`.  However, under certain conditions, the pseudo-element will not be rendered correctly, or the styles will not be applied properly.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.css` file addresses the issue by ensuring proper conditions are met: a valid `content` property is used, the element and selector are correct, the parent container is visible, and the specificity of CSS rules is carefully considered.

This example highlights the importance of thoroughly checking selector correctness, visibility of parent elements, and the presence of a valid `content` property when working with pseudo-elements in CSS.
